MM_Readme = str("Majestic Mountains v 1.0 26/08/2017\n\n- The moss was put into a seperate esp\. This gives the user the choice to play without it\.\`s\.\n\n- Make sure that MajesticMountains\.esp is on top of the other parts of the mod.\n\n- The load order of the other parts doesn\'t matter\. They don\'t conflict with each other\.\n\n- The base mod doesn\'t contain alternate textures or compatibility patches\.\nReason 1\:\nYou have a better control of these optional files as seperate mod\. Because they don\'t contain esp\'s.\ You\'ll have to fiddle around in the file structure for swapping or replacing\.\nReason 2\:\nNot everyone uses SMIM for example. Providing these files automatically may collide with the ethical rules of the Nexus.\n\n- Unused esp files can be safely deleted. It is also possible to merge the plugins because they don\'t conflict with each other\.Except the DaytimeNorth conflicts with the DaytimeSouth\.\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n-----------------\n\n- I would highly recommend you to use the Nexus Mod Manager for installation\. NMM makes it easier to swap textures\.\nIf you try out alternate textures and you want to go back to the default texture set all you have to do is disabling the mod of the alternate texture\. NMM should restore the default texture set of Majestic Mountains\. If not\! Simply right klick at the main mod and choose reinstall\.\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n-----------------------\n\n-Report issues in the comment section or via pm please\.\nI\'ll try to help as fast as possible\. And if I can\'t solve the issue there were many helpful members active in the comment section\.\nI will abuse this line to say\: Thank you very much\.\n\n\nPERMISSIONS\n---------------\n\n- You may change the files and use them into your own mod with following conditions\:\n\n-You change a larger amount of files. Creating a simple texture pack doesn\'t need to have the meshes included\.\n-You want to create a compatibility patch\.\n-You are creating a larger mod like Falskaar and you want to include Parts of Majestic Mountains.\n-You may upload this mod without changes if you give me full credit and link to the main mod\.\n- You don't need to contact me first. A simple credit is enough honor for me\.")
